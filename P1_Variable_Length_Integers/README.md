#### Write a program which stores N integers (N <= 100000) with any number of digits, and is able to perform the following operations:
<ul>
<li>i = j + k - save under the index i the result of the addition of the numbers stored under j and k indices (i, j, k are from range [0, N-1]),<br></li>
<li>i = j - k - save under the index i the result of the substraction of the numbers stored under j and k indices (i, j, k are from range [0, N-1]),<br></li>
<li>min - print the minimum of the stored numbers<br></li>
<li>max - print the maximum of the stored numbers <br></li>
<li>? - print all of the stored numbers.<br></li>
</ul>
#### You should implement your own data structures (you should not use STL library, vector, string etc.).
