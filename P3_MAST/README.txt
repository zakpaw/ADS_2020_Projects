The exercise is to implement an algorithm that reads a set of n rooted trees in the NEWICK format, and then for each of n(n-1)/2 pairs of trees will calculate the minimum number of leaves whose removal from both trees will make them isomorphic. The problem is known in IT as Maximum agreement subtree problem .
